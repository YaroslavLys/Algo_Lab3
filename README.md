## Hamsters
The pet store sells hamsters. These are peaceful domestic beings, however it turned out that they have interesting eating behavior.

In order to feed a hamster living alone, you need H packets of food for a day. However, if several hamsters live together, they wake up greedy. In this case, each hamster eats an additional G packets of food per day of each neighbor. The daily norm H and greed G are individual for each hamster.

There are only C hamsters in the store. You want to buy as much as possible, but you have there are only S packets of food per day. Determine the maximum number of hamsters you have you can feed.

### Input data
The input file hamster_in.txt consists of C + 2 lines.
 - The first line contains S - daily food supply. 0 ≤ S ≤ 10^9
 - The second line contains C - the total number of hamsters on sale. 1 ≤ C ≤ 10^5
 - The next C lines contain H, G - integers separated by a space, which means daily norm and level of greed of each hamster. 0 ≤ H,G ≤ 10^9

### Output data
The output file hamster_out.txt must contain one number - the maximum number of hamsters that you can feed by settling them together.
